# Motivation

As international students and new immigrants, we recognize the challenges newcomers had in finding employment and the urgent need to address this gap. Currently, many new immigrants, students, and marginalized groups are facing some significant disadvantages in finding jobs, not only in Canada, but all around the world. We recently surveyed 200 people and discovered six major obstacles that are preventing them from reaching their employment aspirations:

1. **Language Barriers**: Many non-native speakers find it challenging to create resumes and cover letters that capture the subtleties of the local language and meet professional expectations.
2. **Professional Quality Standards**: Having high-quality, polished, and professional job application materials is essential for finding a job successfully, but it can sometimes feel out of reach for those who don’t have guidance or access to professional services.
3. **Limited Network Access**: Many immigrants find themselves without connections to local professionals in their field, which makes it challenging to access culturally relevant and industry-specific mentorship, results in professional services becoming unaffordable.
4. **Frequent Revisions Needed**: Job application materials, like resumes and cover letters, typically require several rounds of editing. However, mentors and advisors often can't provide the necessary extensive, ongoing support.
5. **Personalization challenges**: Creating application materials requires personal insight, making it hard for individuals to rely only on outside assistance to produce effective documents.
6. **Contextual Barriers**: Being unfamiliar with local industry standards, such as those in Canada, can impact one’s preparedness and potentially lower the success rates in job applications.

These barriers to job searching, caused by limited resources and a lack of knowledge about the position or company, further affect the two most important documents in the application process—the resume and the cover letter. Our project chose to focus on cover letters, partly due to the short length of the program, but more importantly because applicants often overlook the significance of cover letters or struggle to meet expectations. While cover letters are optional in the job application process for some companies, there are still a significant number of positions that require applicants to submit them as an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the position and the organization, career experience, and ambition to help the applicant stand out from the pool of candidates. Writing an effective cover letter can be challenging and requires:

1. Overview of job role and responsibilities
2. Alignment with the company's culture and mission
3. Relevant professional experience matching the job description
4. Strong language proficiency
5. Genuine enthusiasm for the role
6. Demonstrated future potential

Therefore combining our own needs as well as those of our target group, the goal of our project is to develop an AI-powered platform designed to increase the competitiveness of users in their job search by producing customized cover letters that meet linguistic and professional standards. Our tool will provide native-level language assistance and industry-appropriate expressions that are customized to each user's unique experience and needs. And with this solution, we hope to reduce the barriers faced by newcomers and marginalized groups, increase their employability, promote economic integration, and contribute to a more inclusive workforce. This AI-driven approach not only meets an unfilled need, but also puts us at the forefront of the market as we scale to support an increasingly globalized and diverse talent pool.
